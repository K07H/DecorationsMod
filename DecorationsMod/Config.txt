# You can craft the cove tree of this mod in the seeds fabricator (if you enabled the option "addWaterSeedsWhenDiscovered", it will be available only once you scanned the cove tree in game).

# This is the ratio applied to the duration between two juvenile leviathans spawns. Set it close to 1 if you want fast spawn rate, or set it to a high value if you want low spawn rate.
