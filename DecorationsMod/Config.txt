# Note that settings of this section only affects juvenile ghost leviathans that spawns from the cove tree of this mod.
# In other words, these settings do not affect the existing juvenile ghost leviathans and they do not affect the existing cove tree.
# You can craft the cove tree of this mod in the seeds fabricator (if you enabled the option "addWaterSeedsWhenDiscovered", it will be available only once you scanned the cove tree in game).

# If "true", cove trees below 100m depth having eggs displayed will spawn Juvenile Ghost Leviatan after a certain amount of time.

# Defines spawned juvenile ghost leviathan health points. Minimum 10 and maximum 10000.

# Defines the number of juvenile ghost leviathan that spawns before eggs disappears. Minimum 1 and maximum 10.
GhostLeviatan_maxSpawns=2

# Defines the minimum number of seconds to wait before the first leviathan spawns. Minimum 10 and maximum 14400.

# This is the ratio applied to the duration between two juvenile leviathans spawns. Set it close to 1 if you want fast spawn rate, or set it to a high value if you want low spawn rate.
