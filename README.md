### Additional information:<br>
You can change range, brightness and color of the lamp (customizable light) by clicking it and holding various keys. It can be built indoor or outdoor.<br>
You can change the size and orientation of the customizable picture frame, and you can set its content image from the screenshot folder like any other regular picture frame.<br>
You can switch customizable picture frames to poster, random or slideshow modes (by clicking it while holding "F", "G" or "T" respectively).<br>
You can interact with the Seamoth, PRAWN suit and Cyclops toys by clicking them.<br>
You can change cargo crates, warper specimen, forklift toy and Cyclops toy sizes by clicking them while holding "E".<br>
You can change computers and screens labels by clicking them.<br>
You can display or hide the giant cove tree eggs by clicking them (hidden by default).<br>
Giant cove trees that you plant below 100m and have eggs displayed will spawn ghost leviathans if you enable the option in mod config.<br>
The audio effects of the alien relics sometimes stay at their initial position so you need to save and restart Subnautica for the audio effects to take their new positions into account.<br>
All items can be rotated and placed in any base or cyclops.<br>
When you are placing an item and trying to rotate it using mousewheel, if the game switches quickslot instead of rotating it, you can enable the "Lock quickslots when placing item" feature in the configuration (it will allow you to rotate the item properly).<br>
Note that if you place raw materials as decorations, stalkers will try to come and steal them (even if they are placed in a base).<br>
All new flora is compatible with bioreactors and fully configurable (growth duration, health points, nutrient points, etc).<br>
Both long planters can be built indoor or outdoor (tip: you can use this to have land plants in water or sea plants in bases/cyclops).<br>
To unlock every items instantly you need to change "Discovery settings" in the configuration.<br>
To grow plants faster you can change their settings in configuration, or use command "day".<br>
Some additional information can be found in the Configurator or in the configuration file.<br>

<br>

### How to use slideshow and random modes on the customizable picture frame?<br>
1) Launch the game and switch your customizable picture frame into slideshow or random mode. This will create a folder called "pictureframes" in your savegame folder.<br>
   By default it is located here: "[...]/Subnautica/SNAppData/SavedGames/**[slotID]**/DecorationsMod/pictureframes" (with **[slotID]** being the ID of your savegame).<br>
2) Close the game and go inside the "pictureframes" folder. Inside this folder there will be one folder for each customizable picture frame.<br>
   - If it is your first customizable picture frame in slideshow/random mode: There will be only one folder.<br>
   - If you have multiple customizable picture frames that are in slideshow/random mode: There will be one folder for each, so you can sort folders by creation date to find the latest one. Another way is to open the Config text files that are in these folders (they contain coordinates of the customizable picture frame).<br>
3) Now that you have found the folder that is associated to the customizable picture frame, open it and copy your images inside it.<br>
   Note: Only the following image types are allowed: jpg/jpeg, png, gif.<br>
4) Launch the game and the slidshow/random mode should now display your images!<br>
